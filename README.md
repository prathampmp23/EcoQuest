# HackOn_CodeSmashers

# Problem statement :

Create an app that tracks plastic waste in local
communities, encouraging recycling by
rewarding users for participating in collection
and recycling programs.

The app should allow users to log plastic waste collected in
their communities and exchange points for rewards. It should
also provide information about recycling centers and
educational resources on reducing plastic consumption.
